5 Essential Tips for Perfectly Roasted Vegetables

Roasting vegetables to perfection is an art that can transform your meals. To achieve that ideal crispy exterior and tender interior, start with choosing vegetables that have similar cooking times, such as carrots, potatoes, and parsnips. Cut them into uniform pieces to ensure even roasting. High heat is crucial; roasting at around 425°F (220°C) allows the vegetables to caramelize beautifully. Avoid overcrowding the pan; spread the vegetables in a single layer to prevent steaming. Generously season with olive oil, salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs or spices for added flavor. By following these tips, you’ll enjoy perfectly roasted vegetables every time, making your side dishes both delicious and visually appealing
